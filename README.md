# Proof of Concept

This is where I keep my experiments that show how various programming concepts can be implemented in a language even if the language doesn't natively support it. Good ideas shouldn't be isolated to individual languages, this is my attempt to bring some of them together.

Note:

> Quite often, the proofs will just be dumps from a session of expermentation. They will be smoothed out later, the point of this repo is to give me a place to dump, grow and share those experiments instead of scattering them across various gists.
