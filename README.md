# Proof of Concept

This is where I keep my experiments that show how various programming concepts can be implemented in a language even if the language doesn't natively support it. Good ideas shouldn't be isolated to individual languages, this is my attempt to bring some of them together.

#### Note

> Quite often, the proofs will just be dumps from a session of experimentation. They will be smoothed out later, the point of this repo is to give me a place to dump, grow and share those experiments instead of scattering them across various gists. I would apologize, but the alternative is most of this stuff would never be posted.

#### Experiments

- __Python__
  - [use ast to inject code to prevent decorator slowdown](/python/experiment.use_ast_to_inject_code_to_prevent_decorator_slowdown.md)

#### Observations

- __Python__
  - [not all decorators impact performance](/python/observation.not_all_decorators_impact_performance.md)
